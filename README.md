## Guides

### Node.js: General

These are free, high-quality resources that anyone should be able to pick up to start learning Node.js right away.

- Node.js [Getting Started Guide](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/getting-started-guide/)
  - One of the most basic projects you can build with Node.js.
- NodeSchool [Workshoppers](https://nodeschool.io/#workshoppers)
  - NodeSchool is an unofficial community group that has built out various workshops that you can walk through yourself.
  - Many workshoppers can also be run online via the [NodeSchool](https://glitch.com/@nodeschool) organization's workshoppers on Glitch
- Have an additional resource? [Send a Pull Request](https://github.com/nodejs/getting-started/edit/master/README.md) on this file!

### Node.js: Node.js and {{ something else }}

At this point, very few people use _just_ Node.js. As such, it's important to also learn how Node.js works with other tools in our ecosystem. These resources aim to help you get up and running with Node.js and other technologies.

- [Full Stack Open](https://fullstackopen.com)
  - Teaches: Node.js, React, Redux, MongoDB, and GraphQL

### Contributing to the nodejs/getting-started Repository

*Want to write a document?*

Please contribute! Check out our existing documents in this repository to improve existing resources, and look at [issues](https://github.com/nodejs/getting-started/issues) to discover resources people would love to learn from but don't yet exist. To get started, you have to [fork](https://github.com/nodejs/getting-started/fork) this repo to your own GitHub account first.

*Please try to write documentation that prioritizes the LTS version.* Keeping work updated is ideal but understandably tough.

If you want to submit a new feature or a bugfix, the best way is to create the changes in a separate branch, e.g.: `git checkout -b feature/mycoolfeature`. This will make it easier for you to submit a pull request and get your contribution merged.
