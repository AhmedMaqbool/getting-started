## Want to contribute to Node.js but don't know where to start?

Welcome! You've come to the right place. You can jump right in by going to the working group guides below. You can accelerate getting started in any of these working groups by being introduced to a member of the working group who is knowledgable in the work you'd like to tackle. Context to approaching problems is important and these introductions can save you time working on something the collaborators have already tackled. If you'd like an introduction, [file an issue](https://github.com/nodejs/getting-started/issues) with
- what you'd like to work on or the challenge you're facing
- the working group (if known)

and we'll label your request as `intro requested`. A collaborator will facilitate this for you.

### Group contributing guides
- [Website WG](https://github.com/nodejs/nodejs.org/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#nodejs-community-contributing-guide-10)<br>
  The Website Working Group is primarily concerned with the code and overall structure of the [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) website.
- [Streams WG](https://github.com/nodejs/readable-stream/blob/master/README.md#streams-working-group)<br>
  The Streams Working Group is dedicated to the support and improvement of the Streams API as used in Node.js and the npm ecosystem.
- [Build WG](https://github.com/nodejs/build#nodejs-build-working-group)<br>
  The Node.js Build Working Group maintains and controls infrastructure used for continuous integration (CI), releases, benchmarks, web hosting (of nodejs.org and other Node.js web properties) and more.
- [i18n](https://github.com/nodejs/TSC/blob/master/WORKING_GROUPS.md#i18n)<br>
  The i18n Working Groups handle more than just translations. Each working group is an endpoint for community members to collaborate with each other in their language of choice.
- [Docker WG](https://github.com/nodejs/docker-node#nodejs)<br>
  The Docker Working Group's purpose is to build, maintain, and improve official Docker images for the Node.js project.
- [Addon API WG](https://github.com/nodejs/nan#native-abstractions-for-nodejs)<br>
  The Addon API Working Group is responsible for maintaining the NAN project and corresponding nan package in npm. The NAN project makes available an abstraction layer for native add-on authors for Node.js, assisting in the writing of code that is compatible with many actively used versions of Node.js, V8 and libuv.
- [Docs WG](https://github.com/nodejs/docs/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#contributing-to-the-docs)<br>
  This group serves as a central place for Node.js documentation coordination, but not documentation itself. They will help get you there.
- [Benchmarking WG](https://github.com/nodejs/benchmarking#benchmarking-work-group)<br>
  The purpose of the Benchmark Working Group is to gain consensus on an agreed set of benchmarks that can be used to track and evangelize performance gains made between Node.js releases and avoid performance regressions between releases.
- [HTTP2](https://github.com/nodejs/http2/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#contributing-to-nodejs)<br>
  This repository focuses on an HTTP/2 implementation for Node.js Core
- [citgm](https://github.com/nodejs/citgm/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#making-changes-to-citgm)<br>
  citgm is a tool for pulling down an arbitrary module from npm and testing it using a specific version of the node runtime. The Node.js project uses citgm to smoketest releases and controversial changes.
- [Diagnostics WG](https://github.com/nodejs/diagnostics#diagnostics-working-group)<br>
  Diagnostics ensures Node.js provides a set of comprehensive, documented, extensible diagnostic protocols, formats, and APIs to enable tool vendors to provide reliable diagnostic tools for Node.js including tracing, profiling, heap and memory analysis, and step debugging.
- [Community Committee](https://github.com/nodejs/community-committee/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#nodejs-community-contributing-guide-10)<br>
  The Community Committee tackles challenges within the Node.js project that require the many roles outside of code contribution vital to sustaining a healthy open source project.
- [Node.js Collection](https://github.com/nodejs/nodejs-collection#the-nodejs-collection-team)<br>
  A place for the Node.js Collection to organize the technical editing process for articles submitted to the publication.
- [Evangelism WG](https://github.com/nodejs/evangelism#evangelism)<br>
  The Evangelism WG creates promotional materials, brings discussions to a wider audience, and attempts to grow the community through positive, supportive messaging.
- [Education](https://github.com/nodejs/education#education-in-nodejs)<br>
  This repository coordinates education initiatives such as the certification and documentation for learning Node.js.
- [Post Mortem WG](https://github.com/nodejs/post-mortem)<br>
  The Postmortem Diagnostics working group is dedicated to the support and improvement of postmortem debugging for Node.js. It seeks to elevate the role of postmortem debugging for Node, to assist in the development of techniques and tools, and to make techniques and tools known and available to Node.js users.
- [Release WG](https://github.com/nodejs/release)<br>
  The Release Working Group manages the release process for Node.js.
- [Security](https://github.com/nodejs/security-wg)<br>
  The Security Working Group's purpose is to achieve the highest level of security for Node.js and community modules.
